I am a senior at the University of Missouri, currently majoring in film studies. I am 22 years old, and I am from Memphis, Tennessee. After graduation, I hope to move to Dallas, Texas and begin my career as a filmmaker and photographer. Ahead of starting my business when moving, I have already begun to do photography and other work for others at the university, from graduation photos, to help for campus movie fest, to creating animated videos from scratch.

### Names of short films that I have done for class include:
