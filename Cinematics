Along with, wanting to work on film as a cinematographer, director, and editor, I also want to be an actor as well. I have already acted in a few films, such as student films for undergraduate students, as well as capstone films. I was also an extra for a filmmaker's feature titled _Bleeders._ Though I haven't had much acting experience in many professional films, I hope to expand my portfolio and be able to audition for a large role that may be my great **_debut_** role.
