Along with, wanting to work on film as a cinematographer, director, and editor, I also want to be an actor as well. I have already acted in a few films, such as student films for undergraduate students, as well as capstone films. I was also an extra for a filmmaker's feature titled _Bleeders._ Though I haven't had much acting experience in many professional films, I hope to expand my portfolio and be able to audition for a large role that may be my great **_debut_** role.

### Additional Videos I've Recorded
More videos that I have shot and edited can be found under my [youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQz8a6amNQO-sT3-GziSKBQ). There you will find additional videos that consist of dance team tryouts and performances, along with a reel that I had worked on for a class final. I have also done other miscellaneous work that involves video editing skills when making a **mock version** of the **_Netflix_** site.
