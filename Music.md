I also have an interest in music that arose in my early youth. Since then, I expressed interest in wanting to make music, as well as my love for listening to all different genres. Once I reached the end of middle school, I had begun making music with a couple of friends, dropped the craft for a while, then later picked it back up before entering college. This hobby soon led to releasing a [collaboration project](https://soundcloud.com/g3nosavage/sets/open-house) with a friend on streaming platforms. I am currently working on new projects and have one process of being released. 

This interest in music also led me to try out for a hip-hop dance team for fun and out of curiosity. Later, we would go on to perform at events and competitions, placing first at most, if not all of them. A few of these performances were filmed and posted online; they can be found under the cinematics tab.
