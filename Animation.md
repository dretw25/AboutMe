I have a fair amount of experience in animation that began in college. I have taken several Information Technology (IT) courses that have touched on the topic and its fundamentals. I have also taken a course in "**3D Computer Mdeling & Animation**" which was very in-depth and instructive on animation through the software [**_Autodesk Maya_**](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview).

Other than class work, I have completed a video that had a fair amount of animation in it using mainly After Effects. This was the mock Netflix page referred to in the [_cinematics_](Cinematics.md) page. It was titled Blackflix, as it was a homecoming video per the request of a team that was performing. The layout was like Netflix, however, contained only films geared toward, directed or produced by, and/or filmed by individuals of the African American community. This would be, for example, movies such as **_Undercover Brother_**, **_Paid in Full_**, and **_Friday_**.
